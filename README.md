# Memory Management System (MeMS)

## Description
Memory Management System (MeMS) is a C-based software system designed to efficiently manage memory allocation and deallocation in a computer system. The system provides a set of functions and algorithms for dynamically allocating and freeing memory blocks, preventing memory leaks and fragmentation.

## Features
- Dynamic Memory Allocation: Allows the allocation of memory blocks of varying sizes during program execution.
- Memory Deallocation: Provides functions for releasing allocated memory blocks when they are no longer needed.
- Memory Fragmentation Management: Implements algorithms to minimize memory fragmentation, ensuring efficient memory utilization.
- Error Handling: Includes error handling mechanisms to detect and handle memory allocation errors such as out-of-memory conditions.
- Performance Optimization: Optimizes memory allocation and deallocation operations for improved performance.
